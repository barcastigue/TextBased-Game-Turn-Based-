## HERO CRAFT
---
Welcome to **Hero Craft**, where legends are not born — they are chosen.  
In a realm torn by rivalry and magic, three ancient factions rise: **Humans**, **Demi-Humans**, and **Mystics**.  
Each stands proud under their own banner, their heroes bound by destiny and skill.  

There are no second chances here — no grinding, no luck.  
Only **strategy, courage, and pure logic** decide who walks away victorious.  

The battlefield awaits. Choose your hero. Forge your fate.

## Gameplay Overview
Step into fast-paced, **turn-based duels** where every move matters.  

Players can choose between:
- **Player vs Player (PvP)** – Outsmart real opponents in tactical combat.  
- **Player vs AI (PvE)** – Challenge the system in a fight of logic and code.  

Every match is **fixed** — no progression, no stat farming, only your wits and timing.
