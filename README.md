# ⚔️ Hero Craft: A Faction-Based Battle RPG  
**Hero Craft** is a text-based, turn-based battle simulator built in **Java**, created by **Team LARPERS**.  
Players choose from three unique factions—**Humans**, **Demi-Humans**, and **Mystics**—each commanding four heroes with distinct playstyles and powers.  

-------------------------------------------------

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview  

Choose your mode of battle:  
* **Player vs Player (PvP)** – Face off against another hero in tactical combat.  
* **Player vs AI (PvE)** – Test your might against computer-controlled foes.  

Every match is **fixed and skill-based** — no progression, no upgrades, just pure **strategy and timing**.
